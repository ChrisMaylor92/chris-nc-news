# Northcoders News API

Hi, welcome to my project. 

Due to using .gitignore, you will not be able to run this locally until you make some minor changes. 

Please set up 2 .env files in the root directory, like this; 

File 1:
    File Name: 
        '.env.test'
    File Contents: 
        'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test;'

File 2:
    File Name: 
        '.env.development'
    File Contents: 
        'PGDATABASE=nc_news;'

You should now be able to run this repo locally. 

Kind regards,
Chris
